Spring Boot is compatible with Gradle 4.4 and later. If you do not already have Gradle installed, you can follow the instructions at gradle.org.

Spring Boot dependencies can be declared by using the org.springframework.boot group. Typically, your project declares dependencies to one or more ¡°Starters¡±. Spring Boot provides a useful Gradle plugin that can be used to simplify dependency declarations and to create executable jars.
